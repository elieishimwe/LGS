										<p>Good local governance is an elastic and versatile concept .It has been interpreted in many different ways so as to encompass may different aspects of social organization and institutional frame work within which social and economic activities are performed .The question about who are the actors in good local governance is related o which responsibility the state (governments) the civil society and the private sector should pursue in governing society </p>

													<p>Service delivery prior to decentralization did not allow communities to participate and there was little regard to transparency, accountability and professionalism in government affairs. The rule of law has not largely prevailed, while there is preferential treatment, and services are not sufficiently effective and efficient.
														
													</p>
													<p>Basically, the Government has been not been able to be fully responsive to the needs of the people and it has narrowed vision of its future direction to particular priorities. In the process, the people’s faith in government is severely being severely eroded. </p>

													<p>Given such a situation, it has became necessary to demonstrate that change in the way local governments run their affairs is possible. Such change is based on a voiced need for an effort to create and promote a broader understanding and shared vision for governance reform, including policies and practices in regional autonomy and local governance.</p>

												<h3>APPLYING BEST-PRACTICE PRINCIPLES IN PROCUREMENT - A REFRESHER</h3>
												
											</div>

											

											<p><strong>Background.</strong></p>

											<div class="row">

												<div class="col-md-12">
													<p>This is a refresher on procurement practice. It highlights best-practice principles in procurement by a development funding agency and encourages lessons learning in the procurement of goods and services during the implementation of projects. It touches on some of the salient ground rules for satisfactory procurement, underlines the significance of procurement as a process and a function, and draws attention to existing provisions and principles relating to procurement practices. It elliptically contends that in project management, procurement plays a very significant role in determining the success or failure of a project. Good procurement practice ensures value for money as well as effective and efficient operation of projects. Good procurement practice very importantly strengthens institutional credibility and serves as an index of the quality of project supervision and monitoring. The cost of mis-procurement is extremely high and could, in an extreme case, result in project failure and closure. This thus presents elements of best practices in procurement and serves as a quick reference guide that project managers will find invaluable.</p>

												<h3>STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS IN DEVELOPMENT - THE CAPACITY BUILDING CHALLENGE</h3>
												
											</div>

											

											<p><strong>Background.</strong></p>

											<div class="row">

												<div class="col-md-12">
													<p>This seminar/workshop examines the concept, forms, evolution and capacity needs of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs). It notes that in the immediate post-independence period in Africa the growth of CSOs was slow and this only picked up as multi-party democracy began to set in. The scope and scale of their operations vary widely, but nonetheless they have tried to create spaces for their voices and those of marginalized sections of society to be heard on development issues. For effectiveness, the Note posits, CSOs need a great deal of support for institutional capacity building. So far, this support has come from the donor community – a source, which while being helpful constitutes a major challenge to their sustainability. The Note concludes that capacity building support to CSOs should target their programs, governance, management and institutional sustainability, if they are to effectively deliver on their objectives. In this connection, capacity to design and implement their programs, strengthen leadership and its succession, and institutionalize mechanisms for accountability on the part of CSOs to society is very vital. Also needed is a clear policy framework that should guide the emergence of development-oriented CSOs and encourage them to work in partnership with government and the private sector</p>

												<h3>IMPROVING PROJECT SUPERVISION - STRENGTHENING KNOWLEDGE IN PROJECT MANAGEMENT</h3>
												
											</div>

											

											<p><strong>Background.</strong></p>

											<div class="row">

												<div class="col-md-12">
													<p>This Workshop examines, from a knowledge management perspective, the importance of project supervision and monitoring in project performance management. It places the role of supervision in the life cycle of a project, highlights its importance in the success of a project, and analyzes the framework and instruments for effective supervision as well as the knowledge management dimensions in project management. It concludes that for a development funding agency, project supervision should be used beyond its traditional role of project performance monitoring. It should serve more as a knowledge management tool to synthesize lessons of experience as well as identify, collate and share best and replicable practices. For project supervision to serve its knowledge management functions, a Quality of Project Supervision Report should be published regularly and project appraisal reports should contain a section on Lessons Learned in Project Implementation.</p>

												<h3>MEASURING PERFORMANCE OF INTERVENTIONS IN CAPACITY BUILDING</h3>
												
											</div>

											

											<p><strong>Background.</strong></p>

											<div class="row">

												<div class="col-md-12">
													<p>This workshop builds on and refines an earlier work by the author, which presented a set of fundamentals in the measurement of performance in capacity building. It adds value to existing knowledge in two areas. First, it defines four processes, which capacity building (it argues) involves, and second it specifies areas in which performance measurement can and, indeed (it contends), should be undertaken. The presentation is consistent with the input-process-output-outcome-impact framework, which underlies plausible performance measures. This framework represents an expansion of the objective, purpose and impact components of a capacity-building intervention, which are central in the measurement of performance. In other words, performance measures that do not capture in a systematic manner the objective, purpose and impact of a given intervention cannot be regarded as complete and plausible. The Note posits that capacity building involves four processes – development, retooling, enhancement, and reform – and performance measurement should be based on a set of five indicators – finance; quantity; relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, ownership and sustainability; results/outcomes; and impact of an intervention.</p>
