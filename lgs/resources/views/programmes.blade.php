												<h3>APPLYING BEST-PRACTICE PRINCIPLES IN PROCUREMENT - A REFRESHER</h3>
												
											</div>

											

											<p><strong>Background.</strong></p>

											<div class="row">

												<div class="col-md-12">
													<p>This is a refresher on procurement practice. It highlights best-practice principles in procurement by a development funding agency and encourages lessons learning in the procurement of goods and services during the implementation of projects. It touches on some of the salient ground rules for satisfactory procurement, underlines the significance of procurement as a process and a function, and draws attention to existing provisions and principles relating to procurement practices. It elliptically contends that in project management, procurement plays a very significant role in determining the success or failure of a project. Good procurement practice ensures value for money as well as effective and efficient operation of projects. Good procurement practice very importantly strengthens institutional credibility and serves as an index of the quality of project supervision and monitoring. The cost of mis-procurement is extremely high and could, in an extreme case, result in project failure and closure. This thus presents elements of best practices in procurement and serves as a quick reference guide that project managers will find invaluable.</p>

												<h3>STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS IN DEVELOPMENT - THE CAPACITY BUILDING CHALLENGE</h3>
												
											</div>

											

											<p><strong>Background.</strong></p>

											<div class="row">

												<div class="col-md-12">
													<p>This seminar/workshop examines the concept, forms, evolution and capacity needs of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs). It notes that in the immediate post-independence period in Africa the growth of CSOs was slow and this only picked up as multi-party democracy began to set in. The scope and scale of their operations vary widely, but nonetheless they have tried to create spaces for their voices and those of marginalized sections of society to be heard on development issues. For effectiveness, the Note posits, CSOs need a great deal of support for institutional capacity building. So far, this support has come from the donor community – a source, which while being helpful constitutes a major challenge to their sustainability. The Note concludes that capacity building support to CSOs should target their programs, governance, management and institutional sustainability, if they are to effectively deliver on their objectives. In this connection, capacity to design and implement their programs, strengthen leadership and its succession, and institutionalize mechanisms for accountability on the part of CSOs to society is very vital. Also needed is a clear policy framework that should guide the emergence of development-oriented CSOs and encourage them to work in partnership with government and the private sector</p>

												<h3>IMPROVING PROJECT SUPERVISION - STRENGTHENING KNOWLEDGE IN PROJECT MANAGEMENT</h3>
												
											</div>

											

											<p><strong>Background.</strong></p>

											<div class="row">

												<div class="col-md-12">
													<p>This Workshop examines, from a knowledge management perspective, the importance of project supervision and monitoring in project performance management. It places the role of supervision in the life cycle of a project, highlights its importance in the success of a project, and analyzes the framework and instruments for effective supervision as well as the knowledge management dimensions in project management. It concludes that for a development funding agency, project supervision should be used beyond its traditional role of project performance monitoring. It should serve more as a knowledge management tool to synthesize lessons of experience as well as identify, collate and share best and replicable practices. For project supervision to serve its knowledge management functions, a Quality of Project Supervision Report should be published regularly and project appraisal reports should contain a section on Lessons Learned in Project Implementation.</p>

												<h3>MEASURING PERFORMANCE OF INTERVENTIONS IN CAPACITY BUILDING</h3>
												
											</div>

											

											<p><strong>Background.</strong></p>

											<div class="row">

												<div class="col-md-12">
													<p>This workshop builds on and refines an earlier work by the author, which presented a set of fundamentals in the measurement of performance in capacity building. It adds value to existing knowledge in two areas. First, it defines four processes, which capacity building (it argues) involves, and second it specifies areas in which performance measurement can and, indeed (it contends), should be undertaken. The presentation is consistent with the input-process-output-outcome-impact framework, which underlies plausible performance measures. This framework represents an expansion of the objective, purpose and impact components of a capacity-building intervention, which are central in the measurement of performance. In other words, performance measures that do not capture in a systematic manner the objective, purpose and impact of a given intervention cannot be regarded as complete and plausible. The Note posits that capacity building involves four processes – development, retooling, enhancement, and reform – and performance measurement should be based on a set of five indicators – finance; quantity; relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, ownership and sustainability; results/outcomes; and impact of an intervention.</p>

												<h3>POLICY ADVOCACY</h3>
												
											</div>

											

											<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

											<div class="row">

												<div class="col-md-12">
												
														<p>Civil society organizations (CSOs) now appreciate that service delivery work will not on its own engender a just and equitable society. Long-term change in the condition of the poor requires that governments make concerted efforts to address the structural constraints to poverty eradicating and to the fulfillment f people’s rights more generally. Consequently the attainment of these two broad goals requires an enabling political, economic and social development environment</p>														
												
														<p>CSOs have a unique opportunity to propose practical policy and programme solutions –through evidence based research, programmes and policy advocacy work –to problems of poverty and the promotion of human rights. However, an effective advocacy role places new demands on CSOs in terms relevant knowledge, skills and the spaces available to engage strategically with governments and other development actors. This course therefore aims to develop the capacities of development practitioners in policy advocacy work through deepening their understanding of the public policy making process, enhancing their capability to engage with this process at national, regional and global levels.</p>

											<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

											<div class="row">

												<div class="col-md-12">
												
													<p>Development projects are a crucial undertaking of NGOs and CBOs, which need to be designed as instruments of interventions taking into account the socio-economic and political environment. Furthermore, the complexity of designing the operational management and implementation systems of development projects call for technical skilled projects teams.</P>

													<p>Therefore managing development-oriented projects needs practitioners with both technical and personal skills to successfully manage and implement them.</p>

													<p>It is for this reason that Lumumba Graduate School has developed the course on project planning and management focusing on technical and personal skills needed in project design and implementation systems. It aims at providing a systematic framework for addressing development project issues and challenges.</p>

												<h3>STRATEGIC PEACEBUILDING</h3>
												
											</div>

											

											<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

											<div class="row">

												<div class="col-md-12">
												
													<p>This course seeks to equip learners with the ability to build and utilize a more comprehensive and strategic approach to constructing a just peace.</p>
												
													<p>Strategic Peacebuilding originates in the assumption that the successful building of a viable and just peace, as well as the creation and operation of programs that sustain it, is a complex process that requires significant expertise. If, as the American saying goes, ‘war is too important to be left to generals’, than most certainly peace is too important to be left only to those with good intentions or a passion for principled action, however virtuous these characteristics may be.</p>

													<p>This course seeks to equip learners with the ability to build and utilize a more comprehensive and strategic approach to constructing a just peace. The course teaches that to end situations of large-scale violence, hatred or injustice professional peacebuilders must combine their knowledge of the central concepts, theories and findings of modern peace research, with what we know of the best practices of experts engaged in peacebulding and related problems, with careful, in-depth, reflection on how insiders and outsiders to a violent conflict can build stable peace in their particular situation at hand.</p>

													<p>It has been designed to provide a cross-disciplinary examination of violence and peace issues so that learners will have a firm grounding in the central concepts, methods, frameworks and findings which peace research scholars, policy makers, and professional peacebuilders employ in dealing with war and violence. This course underscores the shared interest and circumstances across various fields that participate in and contribute to peacebuilding - sociology, psychology,anthropology, political science, international relations, economics, and religion. Our approach in the course is that a more holistic approach to peacebuilding enhances its efficacy and sustainability. We believe that peacebuilding must build and maintain top-down and bottom-up connections between people and groups at all levels.</p>

												<div class="col-md-12">
												
												
													<p>The aim of this course is for participants to understand the challenges and opportunities in achieving good governance within the complex context of a transition environment. Ultimately, this course will help enable participants to develop and implement effective strategies for building good governance in conflict-to-peace transitions.</p>
		

													<p>This course is designed to provide an introduction to some of the key considerations of establishing good governance after conflict. Through conceptual presentations and case study exercises, participants will experience an interactive approach to learning about the challenges confronting international and local actors when establishing or re-establishing good governance. Participants will leave this course with an understanding of the tensions and contradictions in post-conflict functions; the challenges facing interim governments; the role of the international community; the issue of addressing corruption; and challenges and opportunities for economic reconstruction after conflict</p>
